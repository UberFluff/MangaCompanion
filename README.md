# MangaCompanion

Here's a simple manga reader made with [nw.js](https://nwjs.io/) and ‚ù§.

It uses request and cheerio so if you want to download the source by yourself you must run these commands before :

`npm install request`

`npm install cheerio`

and to start the application simply use :

`nw FOLDER_OF_PACKAGE.JSON`

### Credits

This application is strongly inspired by [tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi)
